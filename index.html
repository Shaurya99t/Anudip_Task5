                Celebrating a decade of its premium NEXA retail channel, Maruti Suzuki has launched an exclusive limited-edition of the Grand Vitara.

                The Phantom Blaq edition is more than just a paint job. The interior receives a premium treatment with perforated faux leather upholstery and sophisticated champagne gold accents that provide a sharp contrast to the dark theme. The bespoke alloy wheels are also finished in black, completing the vehicle's stealthy and commanding presence on the road. This edition is based on the top-tier Strong Hybrid Alpha+ variant, ensuring it comes packed with features.

                Under the hood, it retains the advanced hybrid powertrain known for its efficiency and performance. Key features include a 9-inch SmartPlay Pro+ infotainment system, a premium Clarion sound system, a 360-view camera, and a Head-Up Display (HUD). With the Grand Vitara having already sold over 300,000 units, the Phantom Blaq edition is poised to become a sought-after collector's item for enthusiasts of the brand.
